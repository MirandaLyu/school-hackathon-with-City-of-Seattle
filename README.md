## what this hackathon is about

This hackathon was held by my school NEU Seattle and City of Seattle from March 22nd to 23rd, 2024.

The City provided datasets and problems.

The main data is the energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions of the buildings in Seattle area each year from 2015-2022. According to the City, in Seattle, buildings are one of the largest sources of climate pollution, responsible for more than a third of our city's Greenhouse Gas emissions. So tracking building performance is vital to the bigger climate protection mission.

And the problems for us to choose to analyze are:

Every competing team is comprised of 4 people.

## our chioce - data quality

After a little research and discussion, we thought data quality might be a new and refreshing angle. So we began our exploration around it.

To be honest, the four of us were all short of data analysis skills, so we first used our intuition and Excel to find possible problems in the datasets.

Soon, we found lots of missing values in the newest dataset, and we tried to see the neighborhood distribution of these missing data values. We also digged into how data was collected, etc. This is how we started.

Later, when we wanted to check data accuracy, we sought help from a professional machine learning engineer, updated our tool to python pandas and learned to treat outliers critically. Meanwhile, we also found some problems in data consistency.

Finally, we organized our findings and analysis logics, and presented some solutions. (I attached the final presentation above)

## the biggest gain

My biggest gain from this event is definitely teamwork ðŸªº.

We had no disagreement on the research topic but we had arguments over methodologies lol. In order to initiate faster, I used a lot of Excel to analyze and produce charts for the data. But my teammate thought Excel was not professional. 

So later, we went to see my teammate's family member, who is a machine learning engineer, and we learned about using pandas and more data quality analytical perspectives. And we re-organized all the evidence and analysis at midnight and the other day finally produced a data quality analysis work.

I felt very grateful that my teammate had better analysis strength and business sense than I do. I think we complemented each other in the process. This feeling of teamwork is definitely different from doing projects alone.
